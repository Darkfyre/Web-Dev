<h4>Vlarunga: Dragon Aspect of Flame</h4>
<p>Vlarunga (pronounced VLAA - RUNG - GUH) is the Dragon Aspect of flame and the embodiment of what non-nerds call a ‘dragon’, a massive fire-breathing massacre machine. Vlarunga tends not to interfere with mortals, although red whelplings are the most common.</p></div>
<div class=“col-md-2”>
<h4>Quintara Lotus: Dragon Aspect of the Arcane</h4>
<p>Quintara Lotus (pronounced QWIN - TAR - UH    LOW - TUS) is the Dragon Aspect of the Arcane and has blessed the magic-users  of the world. She also is the only Dragon Aspect we know the exact location of at this time, being located at the top of the Tower Of Ultimate Wizardry which she built herself.</p></div>
<div class=“col-md-2”>
<h4>Yvander: Dragon Aspect of Ice</h4>
<p>Not much is known about Yvander (Pronounced YIVE - AND - EAR) the Dragon Aspect of ice, however we do know that he is located somewhere in the Frozen Wastes and that he created the race of Ogres. Yvander is credited directly for the existence of Frost Stones, shards of pure ice magic created in extreme cold.</p></div>
<div class=“col-md-2”>
<h4>Rokesh: Dragon Aspect of Earth</h4>
<p>Rokesh (pronounced ROW - KAESH) is the Dragon Aspect of earth and, sadly, the god most worshipped by druggies as his blessing prevents unconsciousness. Little is known of this powerful being but rumor has it that he lives at the center of the planet (Or the bottom, as we do not know if the realm is flat or a sphere).</p></div>
<div class=“col-md-2”>
<h4>Ouro’ras: Dragon Aspect of Light</h4>
<p>Ouro’ras (pronouced AW - ROAR - US) is the Dragon Aspect of light and currently has the most classes that draw power from her, Paladins, Templars, and Sunswords all worship the Goddess of Light. Also according to Lola van Drych, “She is also known as the queen of Fashion”.</p></div>
<div class=“col-md-2”>
<h4>Golestandt: Dragon Aspect of the Dark</h4>
<p>Golestandt (pronounced GOAL - STAT) is the Dragon Aspect of the dark and the only Dragon Aspect seen on the show. He has made an appearance in two official campaigns: The Silvermine Mountains, where he was awoken from his peaceful slumber and suppling Elven immortality by the Cult of Bones, and in Woodcarvers, where he completely eradicated the dwarven town of Walden with his signature Life-Ender’s Breath.</p></div>

<h4>The Creators: Kallisto and Phanto</h4>
<p>Little is known of the creators Kallisto and Phanto, mainly because after the Hatching, Phanto was killed by a failed Beenu experiment and Kallisto retreated to the sun. The moon is said to be the body of the fallen Phanto, who’s death ushered in the six schools of magic and created time itself.</p>
