<h2>Magic… and More Magic</h2>

<h4>The Schools of Magic</h4>
<p>Magic in the Realm is divided into 6 schools: fire, ice, earth, arcane, light, and dark. Each school has one dragon aspect despite light magic technically having two (Ouro’ras is the Dragon aspect of Light, but Kallisto is also referred to as a Dragon of the Light and once as the Harbringer of the Dawn, however this second name most likely refers to his body being the sun and that whole deal). The elements are diametrically opposed as shown on the Dragon Aspect Mural on that page, however if you are too lazy to go there I will recap it for you nicely: Light and Dark are opposed, Fire and Ice are opposed, and Earth and Arcane are opposed. All of these make sense except for the last one as there is no real opposite form of magic from Arcane and there are numerous air based spells (Looking at you Summon Air Sprites and Windblast) to oppose Earth, this suggests that there may in fact have once been a Dragon Aspect of Air that was subsequently destroyed after the Birth of Magic.</p>
<h4>Creation Magic</h4>
<p>Creation Magic is a rare form of magic that can only be cast by speaking with two sets of vocal chords in unison, don’t think about the physics of it. But that restricts the use of Creation Magic to Dragons (Two vocal chords), Doubly Intellegent Two-Headed Ogres (Only one known to exist), and Greenskin Goblins(can form telepathic bonds with another Greenskin)… This means that one of the most frowned upon races is potentially able to create entire universes with a single spell. This is one of the most favored fan theories for why goblins are hated by the elves.</p>
