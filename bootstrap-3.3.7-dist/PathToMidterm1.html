<h2>A Little About The Game</h2>
<p>Urealms is more than simple entertainment, it is about letting one’s mind wander to the edge of the world and beyond, it is about amazing adventures and the first encounter curse, it is about creating legendary heroes and watching them fall. Urealms is roleplaying, tucked into a nutshell, and made to grow into a forest of stories. Urealms shows us not only who we want to be, but who we are as people.</p>
<p>In essence, Urealms is an online tabletop roleplaying game that explores quick stories in a fictional world, the world has no name as of yet but then again, what does that matter, In one session you cannot save the world, but you can weave fascinating story lines designed to progress the world and advance the story of beloved NPCs. Urealms is about the players, and about the world, but mostly, it is about having fun and watching people roll 1s.</p>
