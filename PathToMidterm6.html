<h2>The Most Beloved Characters, 1-5</h2>
<p>NOTE: These characters have been listed in my opinion only, this is the ordering that I assume is appropriate for almost all URealms fans. If you disagree, feel free to, however it will not change the ordering on this list until it becomes obvious that the majority of the Fanbase disagrees with this listing. The Characters may also be listed by notoriety amongst fans.</p>
<h3>The Top five</h3>
<h4>Philhipé</h4>
<img src=Philhipé alt=Philhipé>
<p>Philhipé is the Kobald medic/healer from the first encounter of the first campaign. He was successfully diplomacized with by K4 and subsequently became the most beloved character ever in Urealms history. Philhipé’s main weapon is a blunderbuss, and he is known to make good use of his surroundings. Philhipé is presumed dead after the Silvermine Mountains campaign but the fanbase refuses to accept this, insisting that he managed to either get away, or eat his way out of the collapsed mountain.</p>
<h4>Dave</h4>
<p>Dave was a recurring NPC in Urealms until the The Sunswords campaign in which he was taken over by Coe. He is the writer of the notorious trashy romance novel series ‘Boyfriend Quest’ of which there are confirmed to be at least 52 novels. Sadly Dave is deceased after the second time Kyemara the Kobald broke free from his custody in the Murder Bros campaign. Currently the going price for an original copy of Boyfriend Quest Volume 1 with the signature of Davey ‘Dave’ Davidson is over 10 million gold on the white market.</p>
<h4>Trandon Barringster</h4>
<p>Trandon Barringster, the founder of the Barringster family, was played by Roamin in the (first installment of the) campaign The Tower Of Ultimate Wizardry. He is certifiably insane and have been alive since before the Birth of Magic, even claiming to have seen a Beenu before. Sadly Trandon’s insanity was passed down to the entire Barringster family which has caused multiple Barringsters to betray whole parties.</p>
<h4>Kobald Number 4</h4>
<p>K4, the most well known character in Urealms. Originator of the Curse of K4, which is rumored to have caused over 444 rolls of a 4 on the die. K4 is also rumored to have died in the Silvermine Mountains but may have indeed been on an off-site transport at the time (Much like Kyemara in the Murder Bros campaign).</p>
<h4>Maelstrom</h4>
<p>My personal favorite character and the only one to show up in both the animated series and the Stream. Maelstrom is an insane Kobald pirate who’s current location is unknown due to him being left on the elven island in the campaign The New Crew. Maelstrom may have been taken to the Silvermine Mountains and killed by the explosion, but then again he could have eaten his way out anyway. There could be a future campaign dedicated to finding Maelstrom using the same characters as in Murder Bros (Giving a ‘The New Crew’ feel to it without the apocalyptic event like in Silvermine Mountains). Maelstrom’s abilities are unknown but it is believed that he also has the Unnatural Twenty power of Kyemara.</p>
