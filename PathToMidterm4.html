<h2>The Beenu</h2>
<img src=Warmachine.jpg alt=Beenu Warmachine>
<p>The Beenu are the most mysterious of all of the races, they were the most technologically advanced but died out almost immediately after the Birth of Magic which they apparently caused. The Beenu made at least 15 Great Halls across the world to test the mettle of the elves, the only other sentient race besides the Highbears. The Beenu were able to creat massive Warmachines that help advance their goal of constant progression. The Beenu apparently miscalculated a massive experiment meant to advance their progress but which instead killed the Creator Phanto, causing his light to go out and for his body to become the moon. This sparked the Birth of magic and the creation of Time and Death. Apparently there is at least one Beenu Apparition in each of the Great Halls but the only one observed so far was in Zelfatar. Apparently the Beenu in some of the Great Halls worshipped certain divines as stated by the Divine Glamourous the glamshark in the Zarlin Catacombs campaign. Even if the Beenu were to be fully resurrected (Which is impossible in Urealms by the way) they would die out again due to being unable to reproduce. The Beenu were apparently created as the Caretakers for the Realm but so far there have been no extremely destructive forces from outside the Realm that have attempted and invasion (NOTE: This does not rule out a BC style invasion in the future, it merely means that so far no trans-realm travel has been possible, except to and from the Realm of Holding, Which apparently has infinite amounts of the alcoholic beverage Porco Sangrio).</p>
